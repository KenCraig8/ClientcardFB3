•	Provide a way to take in a SQL query that could be specified in the excel document but easy to change 
o	This would be a select query to get the top 1000 rows 
o	This tells you what data to put in the data base because you can have excel how to run the SQL query 
•	Knowing how to format the data 
o	Flexible 
o	Easy to change the format just by changing it within excel 
•	Excel would be running the SQL query in the database 
o	The SQL query would be giving data like the ones listed below 

There are samples of the input query and the output Excel file in this folder. This is just to give an idea of an idea of the general goal, the Excel file you make doesn't have to be exactly the same.

You can run the SampleQuery.sql in the SQL management studio. See the scripts/ScriptsReadme.md for help running scripts. The output of the script will probably be different or empty depending on the data in your database. This doesn't matter as it's just an example. But you can enter some information into the database for testing purposes so you can see the output.

There's nothing special about this sql query. You can make other queries to test it on too.
